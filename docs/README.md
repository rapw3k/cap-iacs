# cap-iacs
This cap-iacs (Common Agriculture Policy - Integrated Administration and Control System) ontology network was derived semi-automatically
from the [JRC IACS application schema](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.05.023). In particular, the ontology was generated based on the 
[UML model](https://lpis.jrc.ec.europa.eu/CAP_IACS/index.htm), which was pre-processed and transformed into a Web ontology network using [UML model](https://shapechange.net/transformations/), 
with a series of rules. The ontology generated was also post-processed to adjust some classes and properties.
